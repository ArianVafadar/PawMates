## PawMates Description:

Our project has several different features as promised in our project proposal. 

* The "Sniff" page is where the user can look through other user's profiles and like/dislike them. If two users match, then they will both 
  on each other's "My Pawmates" page. 

* The "My Pawmates" page is where users can view their matches. In other words, people that they have liked and are interested in hanging out with.

* The "Walk" page is where users can view walks created by their matches, users can join walks and create walks. We also implemented a maps feature which
  shows the path of the walk. 

* The user can click on their name on the top right hand corner and go to their profile. The "profile" page allows the user to update and edit their profile. 

* The "Message" page is where the user can go to message the users that they have matched with. This enables users to easily contact each other.
